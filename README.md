# Python_Hangman

In this project first we get three option for the level of the game- (a)Easy, (B)medium and (C) Hard. Then we have to guess the correct word, one alphabet at a time and every wrong guess will complete an image of a hanging man bit by bit. Once the image is complete we lose and if we guess the complete word before completion of that image, we win.
